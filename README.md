Neural Networks and Deep Learning

With knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Non-Profit, Alphabet Soup.

Data Preprocessing

1. What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

2. What variable(s) are the features for your model?

3. What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

3. What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

4. Overall evaluation of the model?
